The paper is about the wind tunnel testing on rectangular cylinders, a typical bluff body in engineering practices. A comprehensive datasets were built based on a series of wind tunnel experiments covering different side ratios for rectangular cylinders under multiple angles of attack. Besides, we employ artificial intelligence techniques to predict the mean pressure coefficient distribution based on the datasets constructed. Interesting findings reveal that, based on the input of side ratio and wind angle of attack, AI predictor can estimate the mean pressure coefficient distribution for the unseen cases, providing new alternatives for engineering solutions.
